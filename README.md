### Project Description
This was a three week full-time school project. The assignment was to create an arcade game that could profile the player based on [Bartle taxonomy of player types][6].

Gecko to the Rescue is a shoot-em-up action game made with Unity inspired by StarFox. The player is able to move his aircraft, shoot enemies, collect pick-ups, collect power-ups and warn villagers that live outside the village. At the end of the level or when the player dies the player gets profiled based on what he/she decided to do during the game.

### My Responsibilities
During the project I was responsible for implementing the statistics system, the user interface, music and sound effects.

The biggest thing I learned from this project was decoupling my code. All of the ingame related code was decoupled from other parts by using a custom event queue.
To see some examples of the code take a look at the GitHub link down below.
